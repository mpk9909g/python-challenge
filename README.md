homework 3

I am submitting homework 3 Python-Challenge.  There are two directories including PyBank and PyPoll, and each directory has a main.py file in it containing code.

Please note in the PyPoll folder, I have created a "code" directory which contains the main.py file for the PyPoll challenge.

In both files I struggled to find an efficient way to print the results to both terminal and text file.  I basically have redundant code. I thought it might be better to create one string variable and print that one string variable to the terminal and to the text file, but in this case I wanted to keep the format shown in the homework, and my code was best approach given my current skill level.

In the pypoll challenge, I decided to put the percentage in the dictionary along with the vote count.  I had difficulty outputing the results and had to use the items() method, and had to convert the value field to a tuple in order to write the code I did.  There must be an easier way to print out the key and associated values.
